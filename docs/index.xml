      <description>I heard about Hugo for a while before deciding to dive in and get to know it more. I guess the blazing fast GO CLI experience got me curious enough to look around, and after leaving a world of lengthier build times, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking back.
Earlier on when I first checked out Hugo, I don&amp;rsquo;t recall as many of the content management features being available, but at this point, I&amp;rsquo;m finding everything I&amp;rsquo;d ever need to host a personal blog site and in the slimmest package possible.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I&amp;rsquo;m a bit lost these days. I could go into the boring details of my personal struggles and how I feel a bit lost searching for meaning in life, but we&amp;rsquo;re here to talk about professional things. In a professional sense, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my way a bit like Jesus lost his way in the desert.
No, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really read that passage in the bible, and no, I&amp;rsquo;m not suggesting the same moral of the story that a preacher would leave you with.</description>
