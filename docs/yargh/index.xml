      <description>I woke up today, brewed my coffee, and opened my email just like any morning. Except on this particular morning, one email caught my eye: &amp;ldquo;This Week in Rails has invited you to subscribe to their HEY World newsletter&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been following Rails 7 development for awhile and the new hotness that is Hotwire. Heck, the last blog post I wrote was about installing Stimulus and in future posts I want to explore Turbo in all it&amp;rsquo;s glory.</description>

      <description>It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take long while building out a website before you end up needing to code up user interaction, usually via clicking on an element. Before reaching for React or Vue, you can start out with vanilla JS to quickly add an event listener.
myElement.addEventListener(&amp;#39;click&amp;#39;, () =&amp;gt; console.log(&amp;#39;hello world&amp;#39;)) But then you need to make sure the listener gets attached and detached from each element. This is a task most people delegate to Vue or React where special template syntax allows you to call a function when the user clicks on an element.</description>

      <description>While I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about Hugo as a great experience for personal blogging, it&amp;rsquo;s taken me awhile to dig in and find out more. For a long time, I was a medium.com user, and I enjoyed not having to think about publishing my content.
That was until I started trying to write for royalty monies and saw how paywalling content sucks for mostly everyone. I never got paid much and now you can&amp;rsquo;t see some of those articles I wrote&amp;hellip;just like Van Morrison, I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for my big royalty check in the sky.</description>

      <title>Building Back - Better?</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I&amp;rsquo;m a bit lost these days. I could go into the boring details of my personal struggles and how I feel a bit lost searching for meaning in life, but we&amp;rsquo;re here to talk about professional things. In a professional sense, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my way a bit like Jesus lost his way in the desert.
No, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really read that passage in the bible, and no, I&amp;rsquo;m not suggesting the same moral of the story that a preacher would leave you with.</description>
