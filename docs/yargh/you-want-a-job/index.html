    <article id="content">
      <p>I thought I knew the answers to these questions, but I feel at a loss to answer them now. I can
list what I would have said in an interview years ago, but then I can hear myself criticizing my
answer now before it even leaves my mouth.</p>
<p>For fun, let&rsquo;s go through some typical answers you might give to &ldquo;what do you want out of a job?
&ldquo;, and I&rsquo;ll neurotically rebut them all.</p>
<h2 id="i-love-autonomy-at-my-job">I Love Autonomy At My Job</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned autonomy many times before in job interviews, and I think I was being sincere
when I brought it up. I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;d feel if I were ever at a job where I wasn&rsquo;t granted
some level of autonomy. At every developer position, I&rsquo;ve been forced to use my brain to solve
problems, and the requirements were always nebulous enough that I could make suggestions that
ended up making their way into deployed code.</p>
<p>Wait&hellip;if I&rsquo;ve never felt that I lacked autonomy at a job, is autonomy something I should be
looking for in the first place?</p>
<p>And if you have complete autonomy at your job, does anyone care what you do? I mean, that kid
over there playing &ldquo;trucks&rdquo; has complete autonomy over that sandbox, but no adult is going to
hand him a web job because of it. Am I just as naive as that kid when I mention autonomy in the
workplace? Sometimes I feel pretty close to the sandbox when a project I&rsquo;m working on stalls.</p>
<p>When I think back on the jobs I&rsquo;ve held over the last 8 years of being a web developer, the
times when I had more autonomy were some of the worst periods for me as far as job satisfaction
goes. If you are a one-person &ldquo;R&amp;D team&rdquo; then you aren&rsquo;t that much different from the kid
playing around in a sandbox. You might feel good while working, but at the end of the day when
you look up, no one is left to cheer on whatever new prototype you are building.</p>
<p>So&hellip;ouch. The best answer I could think of for the entirety of my job searches is now failing
my barometer test.</p>
<p>I think too much autonomy can be a bad thing since your coworkers should care about what
everyone works on. More attention/scrutiny means less autonomy but in a good way that keeps you
more integrated with the team vs. being a lone wolf.</p>
<p><strong>Instead,</strong> you should work towards asking questions about stakeholder engagement and providing
value to your project. Within answers to those questions, you&rsquo;ll find out how the group manages
a project, when the developer gets involved, and ultimately how much autonomy you&rsquo;ll be given on
the job without having to ask that specific question.</p>
<h2 id="i-want-to-work-for-an-employer-who-cares-about-open-source">I Want To Work For An Employer Who Cares About Open Source</h2>
<p>I used to say this a lot too. I wanted to make sure&hellip;well ask at least&hellip;that the company I
worked for invested in open source. I try to blog and help out with OSS when I can, but at this
point, I can&rsquo;t say I really contribute to any one project.</p>
<p>But what does &ldquo;10% time&rdquo; amount to anyway, and if your company uses OSS and fixing code is part of
your job, then the lines will blur. Plus, if a company does sponsor OSS, then you&rsquo;ll probably be
working on those repositories vs. your own pet project.</p>
<p>And if the company nods to &ldquo;providing 10% time&rdquo; but you don&rsquo;t see that put into practice by
anyone, are you really going to cry foul when there&rsquo;s still work to be done on the highest
priority project? Just like &ldquo;unlimited PTO&rdquo;, I think time to work on OSS can be a risky thing to trust in
a job posting as far as feeling comfortable taking full advantage of the perk.</p>
<p><strong>Instead,</strong> you should actually start working in an open source project you use, and you&rsquo;ll
naturally find out where other developers working on the project are employed and how favorable
they view their employer.</p>
<h2 id="i-want-to-work-in-a-larger-team-where-i-have-more-support">I Want To Work In A Larger Team Where I Have More Support</h2>
<p>This is a legitimate desire of mine after working in teams where a few people leaving meant the
collapse of whole projects. In such small dev teams, I could never feel a sense of respect from
my majority non-dev coworkers&hellip;especially when they were asking &ldquo;did you fix it yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t even have context of what it&rsquo;s like to work in a company with hundreds or
thousands of developers, how can you know it&rsquo;s a good idea to jump into that environment? I must
use this saying all the time for a reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Better the devil you know then the devil you don&rsquo;t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Instead,</strong> try and befriend someone who works in a larger company and form a correspondence.
Buy them lunch or coffee, have a Zoom chat, or go to any event that company puts on. You can find out
a lot about the company before you start applying for one of their jobs.</p>
